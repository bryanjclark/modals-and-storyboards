# Modals and Storyboards
If you're a designer, and you're digging around in code, good on ya! Storyboards are a great tool for WYSIWYG pixel-nudging, and can help you create interactive prototypes quickly.

One thing that you can't do with a Storyboard is dismiss a modal view. (I know, right?) So: here's a quick sample project to show you how it's done. 

Here's how to use this repo:
1. Download this repo to your machine.
2. Build and run the project in your iOS simulator.
3. On the main view of the app, tap "Settings" in the top-left corner, and read the instructions there.

Enjoy! If you have any questions, either raise an issue here, or ping me on App.net/Twitter: @bryanjclark

And welcome to coding! Storyboards are what got me hooked at first, too! :)
